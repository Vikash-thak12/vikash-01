This is my first git hub project..
<br>
My name is Vikash Thakur and i'm from nepal. Github is a powerfull website for developers to write code and many more.
<br>
After using git clone command in my code editor then i apply changes in the editor then i saved it then i don't see changes in my github 
<br>
finally i'm getting results of using git hub and code editor together 
<br>
Now I'm finally back to the github and form today i will be regular to this oper source platform
